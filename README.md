# PhisingProject

## Information of the project

This is supposed to be a fake phishing website. We are copying the design of the bookshop (https://campusbokhandeln.se/?msclkid=ca1eacb8bb821e277628cf4bcb4aca05) as a joke. This is not a real site and should not be treated as such. We will only save user input in localstorage on the user's own machine.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
